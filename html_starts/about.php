There are shoes made of many different materials and designs for men and women around the world. T
he design of shoes has varied through different cultures.

Traditionally, shoes are made up of leather or canvas, but with new technology and information, they are being made from rubber,
 plastics, and other petrochemical-derived material. Shoes are mostly designed specifically for different uses. 
Boots are typically for work or heavy outdoor. In addition, there is a large variety of shoes traditionally available 
for women such as high-heeled shoes, ballet flats, Stiletto heels and so on.

Athletic shoes are made for sports such as running, walking, or others. Some athletic shoes are designed with specific 
features for specific activities, for example, 
roller skates, ice skates, and climbing shoes all provide additional elements designed for their respective sport.</p>
